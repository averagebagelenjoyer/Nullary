# Nullary
> *Note: This document uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/#demo) a lot.*

Nullary is the name of base zero.

Base zero has no numbers, so some believe it can only convey `Undefined` values.

They say it is Undefined since the first place value is zero, and the base is zero.

$0^{0} = Undefined$

However, I believe I have found a way to still do mathematics... without numbers. I am calling this `nullary`. Math, without $‚Ñù$ numbers.

## Displaying Numbers
Rule: $\frac{x}{x} = 1$ (For non-zero $x$)

Rule: $\sqrt{-1} = i$

$i \cdot i \cdot i \cdot i = 1$

$iiii = 1$

$i \div i + i \cdot i = 0$

<br>

Operator: $\lfloor x \rfloor$

$\lfloor \phi \rfloor = 1$

## Maximum Variable Usage
Rule: $x - x = 0$

Rule: $x^{0} = 1$

$x^{x-x} = 1$

## Shortest Path To The Hundredth Prime
541 is the hundredth prime number.

uhhh yeah i was gonna write something here... then i didnt

## Recreating The Digits
Anything can be a variable, even things we usually think of as numbers.

Use your method of choice to get one.

$x_{10}$ denotes that $x$ is in base ten.

$$
iiii = 1
$$

$$
1 - 1 = 0
$$

$$
1 + 1 = 2
$$

$$
2 + 1 = 3
$$

$$
3 + 1 = 4
$$

$$
4 + 1 = 5
$$

$$
5 + 1 = 6
$$

$$
6 + 1 = 7
$$

$$
7 + 1 = 8
$$

$$
8 + 1 = 9
$$

These digits act weird because instead of a positional numeral system, it is a multiplicative numeral system.

$22 = 4_{10}$

$23=32_{10}$

$1018591=0_{10}$

Even weird stuff like variables mid "number" works!

$31 \pi 83=226.195_{10}$

## Note
Base zero is different than all other bases; but not for the reason most think. It's not an invalid base, but instead it's a completely different numerical system.

### Special Operators
$x \cdot y$ is fully optional, and should be shortened to $xy$.

`.` is the nullary point and does almost nothing. Technically it can be used as a number but it is equal to zero, for example:

$\pi + . = \pi$

## Decimals
Since the nullary point cannot be used, we are forced to rely solely on division.

However, using multi-character variables we still have some generally normal looking variables.

$\frac{1}{1+1}=,5$

$1,5=0.5_{10}$

$7,5=3.5_{10}$

$25,5,5=2.5_{10}$

$3+,5=3.5_{10}$

Formally decimal variables start with a `,`.

## Convert Decimal To Nullary

$$
f(x_{10}) =
\sum_{n=1}^{\frac{x_{10}}{\lfloor e \rfloor}} \lceil \phi \rceil
+
\begin{cases}
  \lfloor \phi \rfloor,   & \text{if } x >    i \div i + i \cdot i \\
  \lfloor \gamma \rfloor, & \text{if } x \leq \lfloor \ln(2) \rfloor
\end{cases}
$$

For example to set variable `y` to `512,631`, you would do:

$$
y = f(512631_{10})
$$

Whether or not this is mathematically accurate, I have no idea. And it is 

## Useful Variables
$\aleph_0$

$\phi \approx 1.618$

$\pi \approx 3.142$

$e \approx 2.718$

$\tau \approx 6.283$

$\gamma \approx 0.577$

$G \approx 0.916$ (Catalan's Constant)

$K \approx 2.685$ (Khinchin's Constant)
