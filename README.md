# Nullary
Base zero has no numbers, so some believe it can only convey Undefined values.

They say it is Undefined since the first place value is zero, and the base is zero.
0×0=Undefined

However, it is actually possibly to display more numbers.

# Displaying Numbers
$\aleph_0$

Rule: $\frac{x}{x}=1$

Rule: $\sqrt{-1}=i$

$$
i \cdot i \cdot i \cdot i=1
$$

$$
iiii=1
$$

$$
i \div i + i \cdot i = 1
$$

Operator: $\lfloor x \rfloor$

$$
\lfloor \phi \rfloor = 1
$$

# Maximum Variable Usage
Rule: $x-x=0$

Rule: $x^{0}=1$

x↑(x-x)=1

# Shortest Path To The Hundredth Prime
541 is the hundredth prime number.

# Recreating The Digits
Anything can be a variable, even things we usually think of as numbers.

Use your method of choice to get one.

x_10 denotes that x is in base ten.

iiii=1
1-1=0
1+1=2
2+1=3
3+1=4
4+1=5
5+1=6
6+1=7
7+1=8
8+1=9

These digits act weird because instead of a positional numeral system, it is a multiplicative numeral system.

22=4_10
23=32_10
1018591=0_10

Even weird stuff like variables mid "number" works!

31π83=226.195_10

# Note
Base zero is different than all other bases; but not for the reason most think. It's not an invalid base, but instead it's a completely different numerical system.

## Special Operators
x×y is fully optional, and should be shortened to xy.
. is the nullary point and almost nothing.

# Decimals
Since the nullary point cannot be used, we are forced to rely solely on division.

However, using multi-character variables we still have some generally normal looking variables.

1/(1+1)=,5

1,5=0.5_10
7,5=3.5_10
25,5,5=2.5_10
3+,5=3.5_10

The One Use Of The Nullary Point
The nullary point can only be once per number and every after the point is ignored.
